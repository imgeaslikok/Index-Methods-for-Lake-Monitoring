# Index Methods for Lake Monitoring
This study aims to monitor natural lakes and extraction the water by using some index methods on Sentinel-2 Satellite images. 
Index methods used in the study; NDTI, NDVI, GaoNDWI, NDWI, NDWI-2, MNDWI, NDPI, EWI, NWI, NEW, NDWI-B, AWEIsh, AWEInsh. Each 
method has its own formula and some bands of the image are used. 
In this study, I used the B02, B03, B04, B8A, B11 and B12 bands of the image to apply the methods I mentioned. Some papers I 
used and band of an image of Lake Chad are added for testing.
